GOAL: Create a calculator and demonstrate knowledge of all HTML, CSS, and JS
skills learned thus far. The calculator should handle addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Only evaluate a single pair of numbers at a time.
Create a functioning button display that looks decent. Properly handle errors /
edge cases such as dividing by zero. 

When the basic calculator is complete, consider adding functionality such as a
decimal button, backspace button, and keyboard support.
